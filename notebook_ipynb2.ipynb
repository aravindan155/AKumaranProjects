        "Every year, American high school students take SATs, which are standardized tests intended to measure literacy, numeracy, and writing skills. There are three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a **maximum score of 800 points**. These tests are extremely important for students and colleges, as they play a pivotal role in the admissions process.\n",
